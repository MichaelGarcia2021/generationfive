    <h1>2010 - Present</h1>
    <p>The fifth-generation languages are also called 5GL. It is based on the concept of artificial intelligence. It
        uses the concept that that rather than solving a problem algorithmically, an application can be built to solve
        it based on some constraints, i.e., we make computers learn to solve any problem. Parallel Processing &
        superconductors are used for this type of language to make real artificial intelligence.

        Example: PROLOG, LISP, etc.</p>
        <h2><strong>Advantages :</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Machines can make decisions.</li>
            <li>Programmer effort reduces to solve a problem.</li>
            <li>Easier than 3GL or 4GL to learn and use.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><strong>Disadvantages :</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Complex and long code.</li>
            <li>More resources are required & they are expensive too.</li>
        </ol>
